Notes for CascadeX:
+ Have some way of testing Function reactors using a truth-table like approach.
+ Whenever possible, the predefined reactors should work seamlessly with pipelines (back-pressure).

Reactors for CascadeX:
+ GPB Decoder
+ Async Counter
+ Splitter
+ Functions 0 -> 9
+ Unary Operator (same input and output type)
+ Binary Operator (same inputs and output type)
+ Reduction
+ Switch (Inserter, like Factorio)
+ If (Inserter, like Factorio)
+ If/Else (Insert, like Factorio)
+ Constant (every crank)
+ Constant (on input)
+ Unary Predicate
+ Binary Predicate
+ Filter
