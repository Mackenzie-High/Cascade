Look into extending this to create a Zenity-like program using Sexpr configurations.
This would be spun off as a separate project.
The form functionality will be useful across multiple projects.

Look into semi-transparent overlay forms.
Look into dialog based forms.

Look into standardized forms.
+ Message Box
+ Input Box
+ Login Box

Form elements should be able to be added/removed from the middle of the form, rather than just the end.

Should most elements allow an *optional* label on the left or right?

Configurable context-menus on form-elements?

(bar chart
    (x-label = Girls)
    (y-label = City)
    (bar-label (0) = Seattle)
    (bar-label (1) = Manassas)
    (data (0) = 42)
    (data  (1) = 53))
