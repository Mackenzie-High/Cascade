TODO:
+ AtomicOrderlySender needs to always acquire the transaction lock!
+ Look into propagating InterruptedException in more places. Reset the interrupted flag???
+ ThreadedEngine needs to take a ThreadFactory.
+ Connection needs to allow callback on commit in order to facilitate spawning pumps.
+ The ThreadedEngine needs to be extra careful to not execute the same actor concurrently, unless allowed.
