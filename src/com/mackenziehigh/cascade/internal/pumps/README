TODO:
+ Make SendFailureException a top-level type???
+ Should we do away with Direct Pumps altogether due to the risk of deadlocks???
+ AtomicOrderlySender needs to always acquire the transaction lock!
+ Look into propagating InterruptedException in more places. Reset the interrupted flag???
+ ThreadedEngine needs to take a ThreadFactory.
+ Connection needs to allow callback on commit in order to facilitate spawning pumps.
+ The ThreadedEngine needs to be extra careful to not execute the same actor concurrently, unless allowed.
+ LongTransactionalMultiQueue needs to use LongSynchronizedMultiQueue internally, rather than LongSynchronizedQueue.
+ Finsih the globalSize() method in LongTransactionalMultiQueue.
+ Make sure that uses of ReentrantLock do not inadvertently allow violations of concurrentLimit() via cyclic Direct pumps.
+ Rename setQueueCapacity() to setEdgeCapacity() ??? (etc)
